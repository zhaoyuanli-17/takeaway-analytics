# NLP Feature Engineering – Methodology & Limitations

This section documents the approach used to extract food preference signals from menu
item data, as well as known limitations and potential future improvements.

## Methodology

Given the limited size and structure of the dataset, a lightweight, rule-based NLP
approach was adopted instead of complex language models.

### Data Source
- Menu item names
- Optional item tags provided by the platform or manually curated

### Feature Extraction Approach

Text from `item_name` and `tags` was normalized (lowercasing, trimming) and scanned for
predefined keyword patterns to generate binary preference indicators, including:

- Spicy
- Noodles-based
- Rice-based
- Fried
- Soup
- Vegetarian / Vegan

Keyword matching included both direct terms (e.g. "noodle", "rice") and common dish
variants (e.g. "chow mein", "fried rice") to capture non-literal naming patterns.

### Aggregation Logic

- Item-level features were generated first (`menu_features.csv`)
- Restaurant-level preference profiles were then computed by aggregating item-level
  features (e.g. share of spicy items, fried items per restaurant)

This two-level design allows both granular analysis and higher-level behavioral insights.

## Limitations

This NLP approach intentionally prioritizes interpretability and robustness over linguistic
completeness. As a result, several limitations exist:

- Not all food characteristics are explicitly mentioned in item names (e.g. spiciness
  may not be stated even if the dish is spicy)
- Cultural and regional dish names (e.g. "mapo tofu", "laksa") may encode meaning that
  keyword rules cannot fully capture
- Vegetarian or meat-based classification may be incomplete when ingredients are not
  explicitly listed
- The approach does not account for contextual modifiers (e.g. "can be made spicy")

These limitations mean that extracted preferences should be interpreted as **signals**
rather than ground truth labels.

## Future Improvements

With access to larger datasets or richer metadata, the NLP pipeline could be extended in
several ways:

- Expand keyword dictionaries using domain-specific food ontologies
- Incorporate menu descriptions or ingredient lists where available
- Apply TF-IDF or embedding-based similarity to capture semantic relationships between dishes
- Introduce supervised classification using labeled cuisine or preference categories
- Combine NLP outputs with behavioral signals (time, spend, roster context) for more
  robust preference modeling

## Design Rationale

Despite its simplicity, this rule-based NLP approach is well-suited for small to
medium-sized analytical projects, providing transparent, explainable features that
integrate seamlessly into downstream BI dashboards and machine learning workflows.
