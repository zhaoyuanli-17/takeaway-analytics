### Pay Cycle Impact

Contrary to common assumptions, payday (weekly salary payment on Fridays) does not correspond to increased food delivery spending.

Both total paid amount and food cost are lower on payday compared to non-payday orders, suggesting that consumption behavior is not driven by short-term liquidity shocks. Instead, spending appears to follow a stable budget pattern independent of income arrival timing.

### Rent Constraint Effect

Spending shows a moderate contraction approaching fixed monthly rent deadlines.

Orders placed near the rent due date (27–30th) exhibit a noticeably lower median spend compared to other days of the month, indicating increased cost awareness. However, the absence of a sharp drop in average spend suggests controlled adjustment rather than extreme consumption suppression.

### Behavioral Interpretation

Overall, consumption behavior reflects budget-conscious and planned decision-making, where work context and routine exert greater influence than calendar-based financial events.
