### &nbsp;    Pay Cycle Impact

* 
* Contrary to common assumptions, payday (weekly salary payment on Fridays) does not correspond to increased food delivery spending.
* 
* Both total paid amount and food cost are lower on payday compared to non-payday orders. this suggests that consumption behavior is not driven by short-term liquidity shocks. Instead, spending appears to follow a stable budget pattern independent of income arrival timing.

* ### Rent Constraint Effect
* 
* Spending shows a moderate contraction approaching fixed monthly rent deadlines.
* 
* Orders placed near the rent due date (27–30th) exhibit a noticeably lower median spend compared to other days of the month, indicating increased cost awareness. However, the absence of a sharp drop in average spend suggests controlled adjustment rather than extreme consumption suppression.

* \### Behavioral Interpretation
* 
* Overall, consumption behavior reflects budget-conscious and planned decision-making, where work context and routine exert greater influence than calendar-based financial events.
